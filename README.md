Quite a simple Batch-Script for youtube-dl.exe 
to easy create Phantombot Playlistfiles.

You need to download the youtube-dl.exe first 
and place it into the same folder!

For Phantombot-User i recommend to place the
files into /addons/youtubeplayer and create
a shortcut on your desktop.

Tested on Windows 10 Pro
