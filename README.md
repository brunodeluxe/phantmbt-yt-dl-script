Quite a simple Batch-Script for youtube-dl.exe<br> 
to easy create Phantombot Playlistfiles.<br>

You need to download the youtube-dl.exe first<br>
and place it into the same folder!<br>

For Phantombot-User i recommend to place the<br>
files into /addons/youtubeplayer and create<br>
a shortcut on your desktop.<br>

Tested on Windows 10 Pro <br>
